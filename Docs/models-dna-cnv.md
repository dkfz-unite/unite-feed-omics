## Formats
Several formats are supported for the copy number variants data file.

### TSV
Default UNITE format for copy number variants data file.  
It's a tab-separated values (TSV) file with the following columns:

**`chromosome`*** - Chromosome.
- Type: _String_
- Possible values: `1`, ..., `22`, `X`, `Y`
- Example: `5`

**`start`*** - Start position.
- Type: _Integer_
- Limitations: Greater than 0
- Example: `65498712`

**`end`*** - End position.
- Type: _Integer_
- Limitations: Greater than `start`
- Example: `65608792`

**`type`*** - Copy number alteration type.
- Note: If not set, the api will try to calculate the value from `tcn` and sample `Ploidy`.
- Type: _String_
- Possible values: `Gain`, `Loss`, `Neutral`, `Undetermined`
- Example: `Loss`

**`loh`** - Loss of heterozygosity.
- Note: If not set, the api will try to calculate the value from `c1`, `c2` and sample `Ploidy`.
- Type: _Boolean_
- Example: `true`

**`del`** - Homozygous deletion.
- Note: If not set, the api will try to calculate the value from `c1`, `c2` and sample `Ploidy`.
- Type: _Boolean_
- Example: `false`

**`c1_mean`** - Estimated mean number of copies at **major** allele (calculated from number of reads and sample ploidy). 
- Type: _Double_
- Limitations: Greater or equal to 0
- Example: `1.1265`

**`c2_mean`** - Estimated mean number of copies at **minor** allele (calculated from number of reads and sample ploidy). 
- Type: _Double_
- Limitations: Greater or equal to 0
- Example: `0.0378`

**`tcn_mean`** - Estimated mean total number of copies (`c1_mean` + `c2_mean`). 
- Type: _Double_
- Limitations: Greater or equal to 0
- Example: `1.1643`

**`c1`** - Rounded number of copies at **major** allele (Rounded `c1_mean`).
- Note: If not set, the api will try to calculate the value from `c1_mean` with [threshold rule](api-models-cnv.md#threshold-rule).
- Limitations: Greater or equal to `0` or `-1` if not precise enough ([threshold rule](api-models-cnv.md#threshold-rule))
- Type: _Integer_
- Example: `1`

**`c2`** - Rounded number of copies at **minor** allele (Rounded `c2_mean`).
- Note: If not set, the api will try to calculate the value from `c2_mean` with [threshold rule](api-models-cnv.md#threshold-rule).
- Limitations: Greater or equal to `0` or `-1` if not precise enough ([threshold rule](api-models-cnv.md#threshold-rule))
- Type: _Integer_
- Example: `0`

**`tcn`** - Rounded total number of copies (`c1` + `c2`).
- Note: If not set, the api will try to calculate the value from `c1` and `c2` or `tcn_mean` with [threshold rule](api-models-cnv.md#threshold-rule).
- Limitations: Greater or equal to `0` or `-1` if not precise enough ([threshold rule](api-models-cnv.md#threshold-rule))
- Type: _Integer_
- Example: `1`

**`dh_max`** - Esstimated decrease of heterozygosity (calculated from number of reads and sample ploidy).
- Limitations: Greater or equal to 0
- Type: _Integer_
- Example: `1`

**`*`** - Required fields

#### Type
Type values are:
- `Gain` - total number of copies is certainly higher than sample ploidy
- `Loss` - total number of copies is certainly lower than sample ploidy
- `Neutral` - total number of copies is certainly similar to sample ploidy
- `Undetermined` - variant type is not certain

#### Threshold Rule
To round double value to integer there is `0.3` certancy threshold applied:
if the value is more than `0.3` far from the nearest integer, it is considered as not precise enought and rounding operation results to `-1`, 
this makes further processing of the value easier for the API.

#### Example
`variants.tsv`
```tsv
chromosome	start	end	type	loh	del	c1_mean	c2_mean	tcn_mean	c1    c2	tcn	dh_max
5	65498712	65608792	Loss	true    false	1.1265	0.0378	1.1643	1	0	1	1
5	65700000	65800000	Gain	false   false	2.1234    0.8766	3.0000	2	1	3	0
5    65900000	66000000	Neutral	false false	1.0000	0.0000	1.0000	1	0	1	0
```

### ACESeq
[ACESeq](https://aceseq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/finalOutput.html) is a TSV file format used by the ACESeq workflow for copy number variants calling.
